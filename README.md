# EchoApp
Using Android Studio, I created an app that takes user input and copies it into the TextView below.  
I used a TextInputLayout to display the instruction and receive the user input.  
The TextView changes to display the user input once the Floating Action Button is clicked.  
This project was created for my Android Application Development Course.

# EchoApp
* Using Android Studio, I created an app that takes user input and copies it into the TextView below.  
* I used a TextInputLayout to display the instruction and receive the user input.  
* The TextView changes to display the user input once the Floating Action Button is clicked.

*This project was created for my Android Application Development Course.*
